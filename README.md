## Hi there, I'm Dominik 👋

### About me 🧑‍💻

I'm passionate about programming and technology. My journey with programming started during high school and has been continuing ever since. Currently, I'm dedicated to expanding my knowledge in Java and Spring. I thrive on learning new concepts and tackling challenges. When I'm not coding, I enjoy gaming and working out.

- 🛠️ I’m currently working on: **[ToDoList Application](https://github.com/Doman0s/ToDoList-Application)**

- 🌱 I practice mainly **Java** and **Spring Framework**
